Verse 1
[C]We were both young when I first saw you
I [F]close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing [Am]there on a balcony in [F]summer air
[F]See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
[F]See you make your way through the crowd
And say, [Am]"Hello"
Little did [G]I know
Pre-Chorus
That [F]you were Romeo, you were [G]throwing pebbles
And my [Am]daddy said, "Stay away from [C]Juliet"
And I was [F]crying on the staircase
[G]Begging you please don't [Am]go, [F]and I [G]said
Chorus
[C]Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
[G]I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
 [Am]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[F]It's a love story [G]baby just say [C]"yes"
Verse 2
So [C]I sneak out to the garden to see you
[F]We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your [Am]eyes
Escape this town for a [G]little while
Pre-Chorus
'Cause [F]you were Romeo, I was a [G]scarlet letter
And my [Am]daddy said stay away from [C]Juliet
But you were [F]everything to me I was
[G]Begging you please don't [Am]go, [F]and [G]I said
Chorus
[C]Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
[G]I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
[Am]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[F]It's a love story [G]baby just say yes
[C]Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
[G]This love is difficult, but it's real,
[Am]Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess

Bridge
I got tired of [Am]waiting,  [F] wondering if
[C]you were ever coming [G]around
My faith in you was [Am] [F]fading
When I [C]met you on the outskirts of [G]town and I said
Chorus
[C]Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
[G]I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is [Am]this in my head, I don't know what to think
He [F]knelt to the ground and [G]pulled out a ring and said
[D]Marry me, Juliet you'll never have to be alone
[A]I love you, and that's all I really know
I [Bm]talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
[G]It's a love story [A]baby just say [D]yes
