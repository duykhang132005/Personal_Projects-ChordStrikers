Verse 1
[D]We were both young when I first saw you
I [G]close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing [Bm]there on a balcony in [G]summer air
[G]See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
[G]See you make your way through the crowd
And say, [Bm]"Hello"
Little did [A]I know
Pre-Chorus
That [G]you were Romeo, you were [A]throwing pebbles
And my [Bm]daddy said, "Stay away from [D]Juliet"
And I was [G]crying on the staircase
[A]Begging you please don't [Bm]go, [G]and I [A]said
Chorus
[D]Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
[A]I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
 [Bm]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[G]It's a love story [A]baby just say [D]"yes"
Verse 2
So [D]I sneak out to the garden to see you
[G]We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your [Bm]eyes
Escape this town for a [A]little while
Pre-Chorus
'Cause [G]you were Romeo, I was a [A]scarlet letter
And my [Bm]daddy said stay away from [D]Juliet
But you were [G]everything to me I was
[A]Begging you please don't [Bm]go, [G]and [A]I said
Chorus
[D]Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
[A]I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
[Bm]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[G]It's a love story [A]baby just say yes
[D]Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
[A]This love is difficult, but it's real,
[Bm]Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
[G]It's a love story [A]baby just say yes, oh

Bridge
I got tired of [Bm]waiting,  [G] wondering if
[D]you were ever coming [A]around
My faith in you was [Bm] [G]fading
When I [D]met you on the outskirts of [A]town and I said
Chorus
[D]Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
[A]I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is [Bm]this in my head, I don't know what to think
He [G]knelt to the ground and [A]pulled out a ring and said
[E]Marry me, Juliet you'll never have to be alone
[B]I love you, and that's all I really know
I [Cm]talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
[A]It's a love story [B]baby just say [E]yes
Outro
