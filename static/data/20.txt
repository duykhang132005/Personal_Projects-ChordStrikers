VERSE 1
[D]Hey there Delilah, What’s it [F#m]like in New York City?
I’m a [D]thousand miles away, But girl [F#m]tonight you look so pretty,
Yes you [Bm]do, [G]Time Square can’t [A]shine as bright as [Bm]you,
I swear it’s [A]true [A5]
[D]Hey there Delilah, Don’t you [F#m]worry about the distance,
I’m right [D]there if you get lonely, Give this [F#m]song another listen,
Close your [Bm]eyes, [G]Listen to my [A]voice it’s my [Bm]disguise,
I’m by your [A]side [A5]
CHORUS
[D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me,
[D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me,
What you do to [D]me.
VERSE 2
[D]Hey there Delilah, I know [F#]times are getting hard,
But just [D]believe me girl some day, I'll pay the [F#]bills with this guitar,
We'll have it [Bm]good, [G]We'll have the [A]life we knew we [Bm]would,
My word is [A]good [A5].
[D]Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so [F#]much left to say,
If every [D]simple song I wrote to you, Would [F#]take your breath away,
I’d write it [Bm]all, [G]Even more in [A]love with me you’d [Bm]fall,
We’d have it [A]all [A5].
CHORUS
[D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me,
[D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me, [D]Oh it’s what you do to [Bm]me.
BRIDGE
[G]A thousand miles seems pretty far, But [A]they’ve got planes and trains and cars,
[D]I’d walk to you if I had no other [Bm]way
[G]Our friends would all make fun of us, And [A]we'll just laugh along because,
We [D]know that none of them have felt this [Bm]way,
[G]Delilah I can promise you, That [A]by the time that we get through,
The [Bm]world will never ever be the same, And you’re to [A]blame.[A5]
VERSE 3
[D]Hey there Delilah you be [F#]good, And don’t you miss me,
Two more [D]years and you’ll be done with school, And [F#]I'll be making history,
Like I [Bm]do, [G] You’ll know it's [A]all because of [Bm]you,
[G] We can do what-[A]ever we want [Bm]to,
[G] Hey there Deli-[A]lah here's to [Bm]you, This one’s for [A]you [A5].
FINAL CHORUS
[D] Oh it’s what you do to [Bm] me, [D] Oh it’s what you do to [Bm] me,
[D] Oh it’s what you do to [Bm] me, [D] Oh it’s what you do to [Bm] me,
What you do to [D]me.
[Bm]Ohhh [D] [Bm] [D] [Bm] [D] [Bm] [D]
