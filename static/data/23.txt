[Intro]
[C]   [G]   [Am]    [F]
[Verse1]
W[C]elcome to Wonderland
W[C]e've got it all
P[G]otions and pastries that make you grow tall
F[Am]orests and cottages, castles and cards that can t[F]alk

W[C]elcome to Wonderland
L[C]ook where you're at
M[G]addest of hatters
T[G]he Cheshire Cat
M[Am]agical cabins and lovely
 white rabbits with clo[F]cks

[Chorus]
Da[F]ncing through a dre[C]am
Undern[E]eath the s[Am]tars
La[F]ughing till the mo[C]rning co[G]mes
Ev[F]eryone that lea[C]ves has a he[E]avy he[Am]art
Oooh, W[F]onderla[G]nd I lo[C]ve

[Verse2]
We[C]lcome to Wonderland
I'[C]ll be your guide
Ho[G]lding your hand under sapphire skies
Le[Am]t's go exploring or we could just go for
a [F]walk

We[C]lcome to Wonderland
Wh[C]ere should we go
Th[G]ere's a tea party along down the road
Ma[Am]ke an appearance and maybe they'll sing us a song[F]

[Chorus]
Dan[F]cing through a dr[C]eam
Und[E]erneath the st[Am]ars
Lau[F]ghing till the mo[C]rning co[G]mes
Eve[F]ryone that l[C]eaves has a h[E]eavy he[Am]art
Oooh, W[F]onder[G]land I lo[C]ve

[Bridge]
Noth[F]ing around here is qu[G]ite
as it se[C]ems
N[F]ot sure if anything is re[G]al or
a dr[C]eam
And the o[F]nly thing sure from the sta[G]rs
is the so[C]ng that's inside of your h[Am]eart
Don't l[F]et
it le[G]ave

[Chorus]
I[F]f this was a d[C]ream then at le[G]ast I've g[Am]ot
m[F]emories for when mor[C]ning com[G]es
N[F]ow that I must le[C]ave with a he[E]avy he[Am]art
Oooh, W[F]onder[G]land I lo[C]ve
